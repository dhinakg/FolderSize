Ideas for 2.4:
- Add display option: Show logical folder sizes, or size on disk (GetCompressedFileSize)
- Fix scanner getting blocked on large folders - scan from the scanner thread only?
- Select which device types to scan (network, removable, cd)
- Fix the bad shell updating when viewing parent and child folders
- Walk down the tree rather than hash the full folder name for memory savings
- Fix the delay when displaying a column - reuse the pipe? maybe cache results in the shell extension?
- Improve NTFS junction handling

Ideas for the future:
- NTFS Journalling for updates (timestamp based)
- NTFS Attributes for persisting the cache
  (watchout for ACL)
